        <h1>Taipei: Hidden Gem of Asia</h1>
        <p>
            It was 3 months before my mother’s 53rd birthday when I planned to bring her outside the country — a perfect birthday surprise for the most special woman.  
            Cebu Pacific coincidentally had a promo fare and Taipei was one of the countries listed.  
            I googled tourist attractions in this unfamiliar city and was surprised by the beautiful pictures of temples and parks — the perfect place for my mother who is a big fan of these majestic infrastructures.  
            I instantly booked the plane tickets and prepared the itinerary.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We spent 6 days and 5 nights in Taipei and damn was it not enough!  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I fell so deeply in love with the city that I wanted to go back the moment I left.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I never had this feeling with Germany, Singapore, nor Hong Kong.  
            I know I’ve spammed my Facebook and Instagram with pictures, but to be honest, a lot of my friends considered visiting Taipei after seeing them.  
            It was gorgeous in the pictures but truly breathtaking in person.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you’re considering visiting Taipei soon, this article’s for you.  
            From Visa application to my full itinerary, I’ll spill the beans— with stupid stories in between.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>What You Should Prepare</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Visa</strong></p>
        <p>
            I was hoping that the free Visa would be implemented in September since it was postponed last June.  
            I was unsure whether I should apply or just get my hopes up.  
            I asked my Filipino-Taiwanese friend for her opinion, and I ended up applying for an eVisa all along.  
            It was super easy!  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I was able to get mine instantly because I had a Schengen Visa (I traveled to Germany before) and my mom’s, after 3 days, for P2,700.  
            Here’s a thorough guide on How to Apply.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Book Your Accommodation Early</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you want to have the best affordable place located in the heart of the city, I recommend booking early since Taipei is usually visited by Korean and Japanese tourists.  
            For a first-timer, I recommend finding a place at Ximending — a food & shopping district in Ximen.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are plenty of hotels and inns in the area, and they usually price at P700/person.  
            As for me and my mom, we were able to book a P2,800/night room good for 4 people.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ximending is always lively at night, a perfect vibe for tourists.  
            Just be careful though, since it’s very easy to get lost.  
            Don’t forget to grab a map of the entire district!  
            I believe every hotel has one, but Ximen Inn’s map is the best.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Research</strong></p>
        <p>
            Do your research!  
            Doesn’t matter if you do it a week before your trip, but please, do your research.  
            Plan which places you want to go and don’t forget to read about the Scams in Taipei.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I really thought that Taipei was 100% scam-proof, but holy smoke was I wrong.  
            A fruit vendor just sold mom 2 plastics of fruits for 1,450 NTD (That’s P2,600!) at Shilin Night Market.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Other than that, there’s no pickpocketing in Taipei, and you don’t have to worry if your bag is hanging wide open.  
            I honestly miss my non-paranoid self when walking the streets.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Plan Your Budget</strong></p>
        <p>
            What’s good about Taipei is that it is not that much of a wallet-drainer compared to Singapore and Hong Kong.  
            The current conversion is 1 NTD = 1.8 PHP.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So it’s like, if you buy a 50 NTD worth 7/11 coffee, you’re paying P90 for it. Not bad.  
            If you plan to shop for clothes, Ximending and Taipei Main Station’s underground malls are the best shopping locations.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Hire a Minibus 2 Days Prior</strong></p>
        <p>
            Planning to go to Jiufen or Yehliu?  
            Hire a minibus two days before the scheduled date.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We were planning to just DIY our way to Jiufen, Shifen, and Yehliu but then we found out how hard it is to wait for public buses since they are usually jam-packed, and you can’t exactly predict when they will arrive at the bus stop.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Plus, these places are 45 minutes to 1 hour away from each other.  
            Hiring a van will give you that time flexibility without the fear of getting left behind.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Lucky for us, I had a friend who helped me look for a van.  
            I highly recommend Experience Taiwan — they are friendly, accommodating, and can speak in English and Filipino.  
            They also have good promos!  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Get a Pocket Wifi</strong></p>
        <p>
            An internet connection will 99% save your ass!  
            Taipei has English-labeled signages, but when it comes to checking van and bus numbers and routes, Google Maps is your friendly companion.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you’re like me who constantly shares photos of her recent activities, then there’s no reason why you won’t get your own pocket wifi!  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A 5-day use will cost you only 300 NTD — maximum of 5 connected devices.  
            You can purchase this at the airport and return it on your last day.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Always Bring Your Passport & Powerbank</strong></p>
        <p>
            No matter where you go, always bring them both!  
            A passport is needed for identification when purchasing some items (particularly a SIM card).  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A power bank, well, to recharge your phone and camera, since you’ll be outside most of the day.  
            Most coffee shops in Taipei don’t have power outlets, so it’s better to have a backup.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        
        <p>
            We arrived at Taoyuan airport at 1 AM.  
            The MRT is closed after midnight, so we had to take an 1819 bus going to Taipei Main Station, where we could ride a taxi to our Airbnb accommodation (130 NTD).  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We intended it this way because taxis are an expensive method of commuting, and they add 20 NTD after 9:00 PM.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> I initially booked in Airbnb, but I was surprised that it was actually just a small room within an apartment.  
            The bed was just a mattress on the floor, and the AC was shared from the living room through a fan.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It was the worst situation for mom, who has a knee problem.  
            Thus, the reason why we transferred to Ximending the next day.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You have been warned, don’t make stupid decisions like me!  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We fell asleep after unpacking our bags and prepared for the first official day.  
        </p>
